# LilConfigLink
A DIY, self-hosted LinkTree alternative, forked from [LittleLink](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink). The idea is simple... create a LinkTree like page using a file, that produces a single page of links.

### LittleLink Compatability
Currently, LilConfigLink is compeltely comptable with LittleLink, using all of the same classes, files, and structure. This may change in the future.

### Deploy and How It WOrks

Keeping in the mantra of "it works as-is", to make Lil'ConfigLink work, all you need is a server that runs PHP. No databases, no gulp, no grunt, npm, rails, ruby, nada. PHP reads the `identity.json` file and then produces all of the information.

### JSON File Configuration

Soon to be written, but if you look at it, it's pretty simple!

### Acknowlegements

- [LittleLink](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink) is great. Go support the project.

### Why the name LilConfigLink?
There's a more robust reason, but for now, know that I was listneing to Lil' Jon when I was working on the concept and simply said "JYEAH!" No seriously, that's what happened.

### Disclaimer

The progjest is a direct fork of LittleLink, and has a lot of references to it at the moment. These will be removed / ironed out shortly, but right now, I wanted to get the proof of concept completed before doing a lot of internal stuff.
